Nov 7th notes:
- Group- Deadline is gonna be 22nd
- Tarane finish hangman and Reaction Tap 
- James finish Shazam and does the high score page, Override the back button 
- Victor should just make simon and tic tac toe better
- We need a finishing page (To record the highest time score and Retry button )
 	-High score page 
	-score of each actibity is recorded seperately 
	-in the database we will have the sum of each activity time which is basically the final score
	-Have an if check to make sure no Null values in the times(Each game has been played)
- We need to make the list view much better
- Tarane will do the recording of the app 
- All just start with the report of our own games
 - Change names:		tip tap toe
				Tapman
 				Reaction Tap 
				Shazam-Tap that song
 				Simon- Tap pattern
